# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Managing personal finances can be challenging for many individuals, especially when they do not have an organized system to track their daily expenses without a proper method to record spending, people often lose track of how much they have already spent, how much remains from their budget, and whether they are approaching overspending. This lack of financial awareness can lead to poor decision-making, overspending, and financial stress but u see the problem becomes more significant for students with limited monthly budgets who need to control their spending carefully as traditional manual tracking methods such as writing expenses in notebooks are time consuming, prone to errors, and often miscalculated.
